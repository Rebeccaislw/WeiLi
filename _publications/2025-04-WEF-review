title: "A critical review of quantifying water-energy-food nexus interactions"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-04-WEF-review
excerpt:
- **Abstract**: The water-energy-food (WEF) nexus exemplifies the holistic, integrated, and interdisciplinary system approach, emphasizing mutual interactions between water, energy, and food resources...
  - **Highlights**:
    - No evident increase in the number of resource interactions studied over time.
    - Theoretical studies include more resource interactions than empirical applications.
    - The study of physical resource interactions remains dominant.
    - There is a misalignment between research questions and empirical methodologies.
  - **Keywords**: Water-energy-food (WEF) nexus; Resource interaction; Nexus theory; Nexus application; System approach; Sustainable development goals (SDGs)
