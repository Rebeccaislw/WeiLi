**Wei Li***, Philip J. Ward, & Lia van Wesenbeeck (2025). A critical review of quantifying water-energy-food nexus interactions. **Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews**, 211, 115280. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2024.115280

- **Abstract**: The water-energy-food (WEF) nexus exemplifies the holistic, integrated, and interdisciplinary system approach, emphasizing mutual interactions between water, energy, and food resources. This study presents the first systematic review that critically evaluates the past progress of WEF nexus research from the evidence-based lens of resource interactions, in terms of quantifying the types and the number of interactions studied. Using a novel classification, this review first classifies 834 WEF nexus interaction studies into four classes based on two axes: (1) The type of study (theoretical or empirical) and (2) The extent of resource interactions examined (all six interactions as a 'full' WEF nexus study or fewer interactions as a 'partial' WEF nexus study). Despite the proliferation of WEF nexus studies since 2011, no significant progress has been made towards including more resource interactions over time in either theoretical studies or empirical applications. Moreover, this review shows that: the number of resource interactions examined in empirical applications is much lower than in theoretical studies; the study of physical resource interactions remains dominant; environmental considerations are biased towards water quality and carbon emissions; and there is a misalignment between research questions and empirical methodologies. Further, this review identifies future directions and provides concrete recommendations for aligning future research to jointly achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2, 6, and 7.

- **Highlights**:
    - No evident increase in the number of resource interactions studied over time.
    - Theoretical studies include more resource interactions than empirical applications.
    - The study of physical resource interactions remains dominant.
    - There is a misalignment between research questions and empirical methodologies.

Xiaohui Tian, **Wei Li**, and Rong Li*, The Environmental Effects of Agricultural Mechanization: Evidence from Agricultural Machinery Purchase Subsidy Policy, **Chinese Rural Economy (中国农村经济)**, 2021(09):95-109.
- **Abstract**: Based on China’s agricultural production data at the county level and satellite remote sensing data, from the perspective of the implementation of the agricultural machinery purchase subsidy policy, this article takes the quasi-natural experimental characteristics of the policy as exogenous shocks of agricultural mechanization and uses the Difference-in-differences (DID) approach to measure the impacts of agricultural machinery purchase subsidy policy on polluting agricultural production behaviors and its mechanisms. The results show that the agricultural machinery purchase subsidy policy has significantly improved the level of agricultural mechanization, and the impacts of the policy on polluting agricultural production behaviors are different and with a certain lag. Specifically, the policy has significantly reduced the use of plastic film in the current year and the next year and increased the number of straw-burning points in the next year after the policy started but had no significant impacts on the use of chemical fertilizer and pesticide. The mechanism analysis shows that the policy has changed the way farmers used polluting inputs and treated agricultural production waste by expanding the proportion of grain sown area and promoting the outflow of agricultural labor force, which has a corresponding impact on the ecological environment."
