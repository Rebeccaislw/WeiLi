  - "super good, everything was clear and the class was enjoyable. Loved the teachers"
  - "The course was really perfect in many ways. I appreciated that the content was complex but the lecturers were able to explain it properly and efficiently. The reading material added on to this as it was clear and explained everything clearly. The assignments were all clear and well placed out throughout the semester. The weights of the assignments were also great and made sure that students but in effort all along the semester. The course explained theory perfectly and made students very knowledgeable in it. The exams were great and were actually interesting to take. Overall the course was not very complex which actually helped me understand the subject matter better and become well mastered in it. I really appreciate this course and it was the highlight of my semester. I would improve upon maybe the slides and make them more clear. Maybe I would also suggest the lectures provide Youtube links so that students can revise the concepts at home through videos. Also I would suggest linking the material more to the real world as it
would facilitate understanding."

- Student feedbacks on my teaching
  - "I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for this semester. It was truly an honour to learn from you. You managed to make a challenging course both enjoyable and enlightening, for which I am deeply thankful. Your feedback on my presentation was incredibly valuable. Thank you for your excellent teaching and guidance."
  - "I would like to sincerely thank you for what you do. I really like your class, your preparation for the topics, also the way you explain the material to us. I notice that you are not always sure if we are having an enjoyable time, but I can confidently say that I appreciate your efforts -I am finally getting happiness out of going to university:) In my home country the culture is quite different - I think students are more respectful towards lecturers (the post-soviet society is also playing its role), while lecturers are much stricter and harsher towards their students. I notice a kind of contrast, and it is unclear to me why some students seem to be so disinterested in the information they are given here. It was new to me when I first got here. Also it's my first time in English-speaking society, so I still have trouble with sentence construction in speech, and I'm shy to speak, so I can't tell you that in real life. But I really want you to know, that I'm so grateful that you're my tutor for this period!"
  - "I would like to say some words of gratitude for your efforts to teach us the bases of economics. I had the greatest interest in your tutorials, and I am glad you were my first teacher at the beginning of journey toward a bachelor's degree. I'd also like to say a special thank you that despite the fact that the class was not always active, you still did not choose to remain silent, relying on game theory. It was a pleasure to learn from you, thank you!"
