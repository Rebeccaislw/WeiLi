Student feedbacks on my teaching
======
- "I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for this semester. It was truly an honour to learn from you. You managed to make a challenging course both enjoyable and enlightening, for which I am deeply thankful. Your feedback on my presentation was incredibly valuable. Thank you for your excellent teaching and guidance."

- "I would like to sincerely thank you for what you do. I really like your class, your preparation for the topics, also the way you explain the material to us. I notice that you are not always sure if we are having an enjoyable time, but I can confidently say that I appreciate your efforts -I am finally getting happiness out of going to university:) In my home country the culture is quite different - I think students are more respectful towards lecturers (the post-soviet society is also playing its role), while lecturers are much stricter and harsher towards their students. I notice a kind of contrast, and it is unclear to me why some students seem to be so disinterested in the information they are given here. It was new to me when I first got here. Also it's my first time in English-speaking society, so I still have trouble with sentence construction in speech, and I'm shy to speak, so I can't tell you that in real life. But I really want you to know, that I'm so grateful that you're my tutor for this period!"

- "I would like to say some words of gratitude for your efforts to teach us the bases of economics. I had the greatest interest in your tutorials, and I am glad you were my first teacher at the beginning of journey toward a bachelor's degree. I'd also like to say a special thank you that despite the fact that the class was not always active, you still did not choose to remain silent, relying on game theory. It was a pleasure to learn from you, thank you!"
