About Me
======
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the School of Businiess and Economics at Vrije Uiversiteit Amsterdam.

My research lies at the intersection of Environmental Economics, Agricultural Economics, and Applied Econometrics, with a particular focus on the **Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus**. I am passionate about understanding how resource interdependencies shape sustainable development and policy decisions.

I am on the 2024-2025 Job Market.

I am supervised by [Prof.Philip Ward](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/philip-ward) (Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Deltares), and [Prof.Lia van Wesenbeeck](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/lia-van-wesenbeeck) (School of Business and Economics (SBE), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Amsterdam Centre for World Food Studies).

- Wei Li, Philip Ward and Lia van Wesenbeeck, Advances in water-energy-food nexus: a critical evaluation, under review in Renewable & Sustainable Energy Reviews, 2023
  - Abstract （加粗）: The water-energy-food (WEF) nexus, a representative example of the holistic, integrated, and interdisciplinary system approach, has recently gained currency with academics and policymakers, due to its potential to help enhance resource security and realize global sustainable development. The essence of the WEF nexus lies in the mutual interactions between water, energy, and food resources, which are fundamental to detect trade-offs, uncover synergies and achieve integrated resource governance. To date, no studies have systematically evaluated the progress of WEF nexus research through the lens of resource interactions. This study presents a systematic review that critically evaluates the past progress of WEF nexus literature from the perspective of resource interactions. Using a novel classification, this review first classifies 781 WEF nexus interaction studies into four classes based on two axes: (1) the classification of the study (empirical application or theoretical study); and (2) whether the study examines all six resource interactions (‘full’ WEF nexus study) or fewer resource interactions (‘partial’ WEF nexus study). While WEF nexus studies have flourished since 2011, no significant progress has been made towards more resource interactions over time in both theoretical studies and empirical applications. Moreover, this study shows that: the number of resource interactions examined in empirical applications is much lower than in theoretical studies; physical resource interactions remain dominant; environmental considerations are biased towards water quality and carbon emission; and there is a misalignment between research question and empirical methodology.

(Top 1 journal in the field of Agricultural Economics in China; The full text is in Chinese with an English abstract)
  - Abstract: Based on China’s agricultural production data at the county level and satellite remote sensing data, from the perspective of the implementation of the agricultural machinery purchase subsidy policy, this article takes the quasi-natural experimental characteristics of the policy as exogenous shocks of agricultural mechanization and uses the Difference-in-differences (DID) approach to measure the impacts of agricultural machinery purchase subsidy policy on polluting agricultural production behaviors and its mechanisms. The results show that the agricultural machinery purchase subsidy policy has significantly improved the level of agricultural mechanization, and the impacts of the policy on polluting agricultural production behaviors are different and with a certain lag. Specifically, the policy has significantly reduced the use of plastic film in the current year and the next year and increased the number of straw-burning points in the next year after the policy started but had no significant impacts on the use of chemical fertilizer and pesticide. The mechanism analysis shows that the policy has changed the way farmers used polluting inputs and treated agricultural production waste by expanding the proportion of grain sown area and promoting the outflow of agricultural labor force, which has a corresponding impact on the ecological environment.
