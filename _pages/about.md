I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the School of Businiess and Economics at Vrije Uiversiteit Amsterdam.

My research lies at the intersection of Environmental Economics, Agricultural Economics, and Applied Econometrics, with a particular focus on the **Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus**. I am passionate about understanding how resource interdependencies shape sustainable development and policy decisions.

I am on the 2024-2025 Job Market.

I am supervised by [Prof.Philip Ward](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/philip-ward) (Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Deltares), and [Prof.Lia van Wesenbeeck](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/lia-van-wesenbeeck) (School of Business and Economics (SBE), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Amsterdam Centre for World Food Studies).

Working Papers
======
- **Wei Li***, Philip J. Ward and Lia van Wesenbeeck, Towards an Ideal Theoretical Model for the Water-Energy-Food Nexus, plan to submit to Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 2025
  - **Abstract**:This study introduces a theoretical model for the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus, aiming to simultaneously fulfil six objectives: ensuring resource security; promoting resource circularity; enabling transferability across spatial and temporal scales and geographic scopes; maintaining empirical feasibility; integrating economic, environmental, and societal considerations; and facilitating comprehensive and equal identification of resource interactions. The model builds on an established regional water economy model for the Jordan River Basin. Through stepwise adjustments, we demonstrate that the enhanced model successfully achieves all six objectives. Additionally, this model innovatively incorporates the welfare of animals and potentially plants, moving beyond a human-centered perspective. This pioneering model addresses gaps in the WEF nexus research and lays the groundwork for future investigations into human-nature interactions in the Anthropocene.
